#
# It is recommended to not store the screenshots in the git repo. Instead, use fastlane to re-generate the
# screenshots whenever they are needed, or store them in a separate git repo.
#
# The screenshots folder will be stored on the device/simulator and not in the repo, so you can
# delete this folder after running the screenshot generation command. You can choose to ignore the
# screenshots folder by adding the following entry to your .gitignore file:
#
# fastlane/report.xml
# fastlane/Preview.html
# fastlane/screenshots
# fastlane/test_output
